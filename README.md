# House, M.C.
Markov chain text generator based on [everything Dr. Gregory House ever said](http://clinic-duty.livejournal.com/12225.html).

**Examples:**
* "Listen, Vogler's suggestion was idiotic â€” we're amazing."
* "I need to look there, cut it off."
* "It's a parasite. Because if we can confirm an infection from the bus."
* "Hi. Guess I should have told her that every day should be naked pictures."
* "What did I fire you. BOO! Just tell them how appalling the doctor."

**Files:**
* `HouseMD.ipynb` is a Jupyter/IPython notebook with the code and some sample results.
* `HouseMD.py` is essentially the same code, but meant to be run at the command line, with an optional argument for text length. For example, type "`python HouseMC.py 30`" for a quote that's about 3 times as long as the default.
* `filenames.txt` contains a list that is needed to run either version of the script.

**Note**: Running this script will use about 36 MB of disk space.
