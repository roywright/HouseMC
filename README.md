# House, M.C.
Markov chain text generator based on [everything Dr. Gregory House ever said](http://clinic-duty.livejournal.com/12225.html). (I've never done this before, so it's a work in progress.)

Samples:
* "Listen, Vogler's suggestion was idiotic â€” we're amazing."
* "I need to look there, cut it off."
* "It's a parasite. Because if we can confirm an infection from the bus."
* "Hi. Guess I should have told her that every day should be naked pictures."


Files:
* HouseMD.ipynb is a Jupyter/IPython notebook with the code and some sample results.
* HouseMD.py is essentially the same code, but meant to be run at the command line.
* filenames.txt is a list of filenames for episode transcripts, which are available at the link above.
